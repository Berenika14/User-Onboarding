# Module Project: Advanced Form Management - User Onboarding

## Project Description

We've seen many different styles of form management by now -- simple to complex. Today we are going to unleash your inner form-wizard! 🧙

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set Up The Project

- [ ] Start off by installing a blank React app by running `npx create-react-app <app-name> --use-npm`.
- [ ] Run `cd <app-name>` to cd into the `<app-name>` directory.
- [ ] Using `npm`, add the following as dependencies inside your React app:
  - `yup`
  - `axios`
- [ ] Create a component file called `Form.js`, import it into your `App.js` file, and place the component in your JSX there.

### Task 2: MVP

#### Create Your Advanced Form

We want to create a form to onboard a new user to our system. We need _at least_ the following pieces of information about our new user:

- [ ] Name
- [ ] Email
- [ ] Password
- [ ] Terms of Service (checkbox)
- [ ] A Submit button to send our form data to the server.

#### Implement Form Validation and Error Messaging

Form validation is one of the facets of an application that makes it feel polished and controlled from a user perspective. With that in mind, implement the following:

- [ ] Using Yup, set up _at least_ two different validations along with custom error messages that will display on screen when validation fails.
